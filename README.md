# User Manager Application

This application is a simple system to manage users of some arbitrary information system. It implements REST architecture and all of its services are exposed as REST APIs.

Technologies used are: JPA/Hibernate, Liquibase and MySQL


## Database schema

![usandpassliquiyml](https://github.com/VladO2567/UserManagement_JR/blob/master/src/main/resources/media/usandpassliquiyml.png)

By running the application empty usermanagement database schema will be created if it already doesn't exist.

![datasourceurl](https://github.com/VladO2567/UserManagement_JR/blob/master/src/main/resources/media/datasourceurl.png)

If your database or MySQL server are set up differently adjust the datasource url.

Liquibase will then generate and insert tables into it. Data for the tables will be inserted from sql files in src/main/resources/db/changelog/seeds folder.

Everything is ready to run the application :D
